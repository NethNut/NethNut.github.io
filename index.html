    <h2 class="subtitle">What are Orcas</h2>
    <p class="text">Orcas, also known as killer whales, are the largest of the dolphins and one of the worlds most powerful predators. They are immediately recognizable by their distinctive black-and-white coloring. Smart and social, orcas make a wide variety of communicative sounds, and each pod has distinctive noises that its members will recognize even at a distance1.</p>
